### Hey there, I'm Ben! 

I just graduated :mortar_board: with master's degree in data science from University of Michigan and have an undergrad in mathematics from Colorado State. I've got 3 years of computational computing experience in Python and enjoy working on interdisciplinary teams, model building, creating great data pipelines, and more. I am actively looking for a data science position.

My most recent, pinned projects:  
1) :persevere: teambraininac is my master's capstone. I worked on a team of three master's students on 3D real-time fMRI brain image data. In this project, I built a 3D convolutional neural network to predict brain states and compared CNN prediction accuracies to more traditional support vector machines approaches. Our [website is here](https://share.streamlit.io/yecatstevir/teambrainiac/main/source/streamlit/landing_page.py) and [our paper is here](https://github.com/yecatstevir/teambrainiac/blob/main/Capstone_Final_Report.pdf).
2) :family: In predicting_population_california_with_machine_learning, we wrangled data from ~10 public sources and used supervised and unsupervised learning approaches to find interesting connections between geographic, economic, racial, societal, and environmental attributes in California counties. [Here is our final paper](https://github.com/benmerrilll/predicting_population_california_with_machine_learning/blob/main/Final%20Project%20-%20County%20Population%20Changes%20(1).pdf).
3) :school_satchel: graduate-student-instructor-notebook-examples is a repository that showcases a few Jupyter notebooks that I developed for office hours while on the instructional staff for a Network Analysis (graph theory) course in my master's program. You can find an [example of office hours here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfHZEESgb28).
