### Hi, I'm Ben!

I've got a master's degree in data science from University of Michigan and an undergraduate in mathematics from Colorado State. I've got 3 years of computational computing experience in Python. I enjoy using applied statistics for significance testing and causal inference, applying deep learning techniques to eek out extra accuracy in a prediction problems, maintaining ETL workflows, and more. 

My most recent, pinned projects:  
1) teambraininac is my master's capstone. I worked on a team of three master's students on 3D real-time fMRI brain image data. We worked under Megan Martz, Ph.D., who is utilizing fMRI to understand people's ability to regulate their brain reward's system in hopes to help people control their substance abuse tendencies. In this project, I built a 3D convolutional neural network and compared prediction accuracies to traditional support vector machines approaches. Our [website is here](https://share.streamlit.io/yecatstevir/teambrainiac/main/source/streamlit/landing_page.py) and [our paper is here](https://github.com/yecatstevir/teambrainiac/blob/main/Capstone_Final_Report.pdf).

2) predicting_population_california_with_machine_learning was another team project. We used supervised and unsupervised approaches to predict population changes by county in California. Wrangling data from around 10 sources, we were able to find interesting correlations between geographic, economic, racial, societal, and environmental attributes between counties. [Here is our final paper](https://github.com/benmerrilll/predicting_population_california_with_machine_learning/blob/main/Final%20Project%20-%20County%20Population%20Changes%20(1).pdf).

3) graduate-student-instructor-notebook-examples is a repository that to showcase a few Jupyter notebooks that I developed for office hours while on the instructional staff for a Network Analysis (graph theory) course in my master's program. You can find an [example office hours here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfHZEESgb28).
